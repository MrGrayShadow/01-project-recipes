# odin-recipes

The goal of my first web development project is to apply the HTML skills acquired in the first section of the foundations
course in **The Odin Project** to create a website that contains links, images and descriptions to four recipes.  These skills include:

- Type out HTML boilerplate:
	- HTML root element
	- Head:
		- Meta
		- Title
	- Body
- Use HTML elements:
  - Anchor `<a>`
  - Ordered `<ol></ol>` and unordered `<ul></ul>` lists `<li></li>`
  - Heading `<h1></h1>`
  - Paragraphs `<p></p>`
- Link to relative webpages with href
- Link to relative images with src
- Differentiate between absolute and relative links
- Using git and github
- Write git commits in imperative voice
- Keep git commit subject line to 50 characters or less that summarizes the change
- Leave a blank line between the subject line and body of a commit
- Wrap the body of the commit at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain the what and why of the code changes
