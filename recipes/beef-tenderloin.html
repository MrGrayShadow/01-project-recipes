        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This grilled beef tenderloin is seasoned with rosemary, thyme, and garlic, then grilled to a rosy pink. This grilled beef tenderloin recipe is impressive enough for the pickiest dinner guests, but surprisingly easy to make with simple ingredients. This tenderloin recipe makes tender, mouth-watering beef. We've had it for both of our Christmas dinners this year (with two families) and got rave reviews from everyone. Hard to believe it's so simple to prepare!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (5 lb) whole beef tenderloin</li>
                <li>8 minced garlic cloves</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon dried thyme leaves</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Use a <strong>sharp</strong> knife or scissors to remove silverskin and trim excess fat from tenderloin. Fold the thinner end under to approximate the thickness of the rest of the roast and tie with <em>butcher's twine</em> to secure. Tie tenderloin in 1&frac12; to 2-inch intervals to help it keep its shape during cooking.</li>
                <li>Mix together garlic, oil, rosemary, pepper, thyme, and salt in a small bowl; rub over tenderloin to coat. Let sit while you preheat the grill.</li>
                <li>Light a charcoal fire in one half of a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill to high for 10 minutes and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                <li>Place tenderloin on the <strong>hot</strong> grill and close the lid. Grill until well-seared, about 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side.</li>
                <li>Move tenderloin to the cool side of the charcoal grill, or if using a gas grill, turn off the burner directly underneath the tenderloin and turn the remaining one or two burners (depending on grill style) to medium. Cook until rosy pink and a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest section registers 130&deg;F (54&deg;C), 45 - 60 minutes. Cook time will depend on tenderloin size and grill.</li>
                <li>Let tenderloin rest 15 minutes before carving.</li>
            </ol>
